        Suppression rules for false positives in dependency security scanning.
        Each suppression should include:
        - Detailed rationale for why it's safe to suppress
        - Specific CVE or vulnerability being suppressed
        - Expiration date for review

    <!-- JNI/Native library suppressions -->
    <suppress>
        <notes>
            Native libraries are compiled locally and managed separately from Maven dependencies.
            CVE scanning on .so/.dll files may produce false positives.

    <!-- Ghidra-related suppressions -->
    <suppress>
        <notes>
            Ghidra is typically installed as a separate application and not managed as a Maven dependency.
            Any CVEs related to Ghidra should be addressed through Ghidra updates, not dependency management.
